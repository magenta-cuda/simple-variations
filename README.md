# simple-variations

Simple Variations is a Classic Commerce extension that implements the variations of a Classic Commerce variable product as the Cartesian product of its variation attributes. Simple Variations uses the variation attributes of a Classic Commerce variable product to specify the components of a composite product. Since the properties of a specific variation of a composite product can be derived from the properties of the specific components that form the variation, the variation does not need to exists in the database but can be generated dynamically from the components. For example, consider ordering a custom made hamburger where the customer can choose from different types of meats, buns and cheeses. The price of the chosen hamburger would be the sum of the prices of the selected meat, bun and cheese. So, instead of specifying the price for the Cartesian product of the components only the price of the individual components need to be specified. Similiarly, the in stock quantity would be the minimum of the in stock quantities of the selected components. Since the composite variations are virtual  (I.e. – They don’t really exists but are dynamically generated as needed.), this extension can very efficiently (constant time O(1) and constant storage O(1) with respect to n number of variations) support up to 8,192 products each of which can have up to 562,949,953,421,312 variations.
